            <h2>Branding has a variety of types.</h2>
            <p>The marketing process known as "branding" encompasses many subsets of efforts. The same holds true for digital branding; depending on your company's goals and the sector in which you operate, you may find that one strategy or another is more effective.</p>
            <p>There are seven different branding types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Product Branding</strong> – is the most common type of branding. It involves the promotion of a particular good or service in a variety of markets, using words, colors, and images to differentiate one product from another. Effective product branding starts with an understanding of the end consumer, their desires and the competitive landscape that you’re entering. All of these variables help determine the brand strategy, which will in turn, impact the product roadmap.</li>
              <li><strong>Corporate Branding</strong> - encompasses all of the activities that are utilized in the process of establishing and maintaining a brand identity. These activities range from determining the pricing of your products to identifying your target audience and determining how you will interact with all of your stakeholders. For instance, a luxury brand will keep its exclusive status by charging significantly higher prices.</li>
              <li><strong>Service Branding</strong> - Regardless of the industry you're in, one of your greatest challenges will be to consistently provide excellent service. Service is all about your relationship with the customer or service recipient. Your service is defined by the experience you provide your customers, regardless of whether they call your hotline, visit your store, or meet with you in person.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal Branding</strong> - Personal branding is frequently associated with public figures such as politicians, athletes, and social media influencers. This element of fame is a key success factor for many successful entrepreneurs. Gaining a social profile can aid business leaders in acquiring new clients and gaining new followers.</li>
              <li><strong>Geographic Branding</strong> - Geographic branding seeks to attract people to visit or invest in a company or region because of a geographic association. Cities, regions, and entire countries practice geographic branding by capitalizing on the things that set them apart from other areas, such as tourist attractions or areas of natural beauty.</li>
              <li><strong>Cultural Branding</strong> - Cultural branding seeks to build a positive shared identity and reputation for the people living in a particular place or of a specific nationality. It is closely linked to geographic branding. The two types of branding go hand in hand – a place’s geography influences the culture of its people, and human activities affect the place.</li>
              <li><strong>Retail Branding</strong> - Retailers are the stores we all frequent on a daily basis. Numerous retailers sell merchandise from numerous manufacturers. In a supermarket, for instance, similar products from competing brands are placed side by side. Others sell only products bearing their own brand name. Retailers strive to establish their own unique brand. The term for this is retail branding. Apple is one of the most well-known examples of an instantly recognizable retail brand. Their stores are frequently architectural masterpieces. The aesthetic design of the stores reflects the significance of good design to the company's products.</li>

            <h2>Developing your digital brand strategy</h2>
            <p>As stated previously, the initial step in developing a successful digital branding strategy is research. Using market research and workshops, you must first determine who your audience is, what sets you apart from other organizations that serve the same audience, and the most effective way to convey this information.
              Regardless of the nature of your digital product, you must choose its visual design, the voice of the content that surrounds it, and the branding ecosystem into which it will fit.
              The right digital branding partner will guide you through the discovery process to determine the identity you wish to project, as well as create moodboards and a visual brand identity.
              Once everything has been determined, you can create a style guide to inform future branding activities and ensure that your digital marketing activities are consistent with the brand's overall identity.</p>
